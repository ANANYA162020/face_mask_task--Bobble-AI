# face_mask_task
first i have imported all the packages-
1.import numpy as np
2.import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
3.import numpy as np
in this task first i have made a face directory using mkdir faces command

then reading a paricular image and then the other through open cv
then the data preprocessing has been done where we have specified the required dimensions of all the images or the particular image we need for processing
then we are loading/reading the masked image and then resizing the cropped image to the required dimensions


then in the function crop_by_mask we are doing the masking technique where the cropped image or the cropped face is attached with the framed one


and then we just result the output 


all the lines of the code are compiled and run by pressing the arrow on the left most side
